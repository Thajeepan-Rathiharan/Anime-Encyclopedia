<!-- Autoplay was added so that the video starts up for the user because without this attribute the play button was hard to select for mobile users and the video wasn't shown
     unless the play button was pressed. The video has been put on loop so that it's easier for the user to rewatch the video if they wanted to after watching it for the first
     time. The video is muted by default because the user(s) might get a jump scare with the audio playing without their control especially if their volume was on high. -->

<p> Sorry to tell you that your broswer does not support the video element shown on the page. However there is an alternative way of viewing the video, which is by clicking the link below.
<a href="video/mp4.mp4"> Naruto Shippuden Trailer</a></p>
</video>

<!--The <video> element is put here so that I can include a video on my webpage. There are 3 formats here, so that on the broswer if one format doesn't work, the browser can then use one of that other two that it can use.
  The <a> element is then used after that, so that if the browser doesn't support either of the formats, they can view it on a seperate tab by clicking on the link given. In other words, this is called the fallback.
  The video is controled within the <video> element where the size of the video is set and if I wanted the video to play by itself and look, I can use values like loop or autoplay to control it, or just leave it so that the user can choose whether to play the video or not.
  </video> is put at the end after the video element is put in, so that it tells the browser that the <video> section is done so that elements after that such as for this example the <footer> becomes visible for the user.
