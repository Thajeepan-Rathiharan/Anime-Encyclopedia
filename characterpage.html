        <p>
          Obito Uchiha is one of the main villains in the series who went by the names of Tobi and Madara up until the war where his mask was broken to reveal his identity. He was the classmate of Kakashi and Rin under the lead of Minato, he was in love with Rin but never got his chance to tell her as he witnessed Kakashi kill her from a distance when he was rushing to save her but was too late. Due to this he changed his dream of wanting to become Hokage and went down the path of revenge by plotting against everyone and teaming up with Madara Uchiha. The reason was because Madara was the one to save him when he was crushed by a giant boulder, but later on in the series he finds out Madara lied to him, to use him as his puppet and turns into a good guy aiding Naruto and the others in the war. His first appearance in the show was as Tobi is in episode 139, the episoode where he was revealed to be Obito was in episode 344.

          Rin was the former team mate of Kakshi and Obito with Minato as their leader, she was in love with Obito but never mentioned it. Her first appearance was in episode 72 and it was during a flashback showing how the team was formed up to her death in episode 345 later in the series when the flashback is from Obito's view. Her death was due to her having a monster put inside her that took complete control over her by the enemy village trying to use her to destroy the Hidden Leaf, however she jumped into an attack by Kakashi that led him to killing her which was an accident, but she did it on purpose to stop the enemies plan to destroy the village.
